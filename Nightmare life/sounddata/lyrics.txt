Depth, death and toxic juice. What more will be in a world that is in another galaxy?

Aliens have found a way to directly get over the black hole to jump to that galaxy. 1 thereof is stuck. That is in a wrong galaxy. He starts to panic.

About that world, the alien is stuck in. It Seems to me dangerous. Because there are nightmares your life. Toxic juice that penetrates to the heart of an object, and let it explode. Worms with long spines and a sharp beak, who are killing people , aliens or intrusive objects.
