What is Delkoo?
--------------------------
Delkoo is an animation viewer.
Because in Windows XP, sometimes you click an gif image.
He can't play it. Because its hard to view the frames.
The example works on Windows. But some don't.

Just start Delkoo.exe and click the cow. Then the program will load setimg.gif that is your gif(read WhatSetimg.txt, for more info about this file) You can set the speed of the image too.
